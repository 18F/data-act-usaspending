# DATA Act USAspending Beta

This repository contains the user stories and other issue tracking artifacts for the beta DATA Act version of the USAspending website.

## Overview

As part of the DATA Act implementation, the U.S. Treasury Department will be expanding the scope of federal spending data presented on USAspending.gov (or a successor website). The project currently underway is a an exploration of how such a site might function and the audiences it will serve.

This repo does not contain code. Rather, it's a place for the project team to manage the user stories that will drive the work.
